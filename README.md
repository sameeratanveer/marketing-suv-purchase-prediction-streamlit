# SUV-Car-Purchase-Prediction
In this project, I used a dataset containing customer information such as age, gender, and salary to build a model that predicts whether a customer will purchase an SUV. 

I experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. 

After evaluating their performance, Gaussian Naive Bayes stood out with the best accuracy at 92%.

Additionally, the model is then integrated into a web application using Streamlit.
